## The Performance-Preference Paradox

As described in this link, although we may prefer nice colorful
screens, it is very often the case that we 
[perform more poorly when using them](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/satisfaction-vs-performance-metrics/).


I thought I would take a moment to briefly describe one aspect of the
design of Nightscout: the boring colors (grey on black background).
Their intent is to make salient information stand out. This is why the
colors are muted and boring when nothing interesting is happening - it
facilitates a quick glance and then you can get on with life. The only
time red or yellow colors appear is when attention needs to be drawn
to the display.

In heavily automated, mission critical environments, great care is
taken in the design of human machine interfaces. Cockpits and control
rooms are two examples. 

As a result of many catastrophic incidents, the Abnormal Situation
Management (ASM) Consortium was formed over 20 years ago, and I was
privileged to be involved from the beginning. When I worked for
Honeywell in their industrial automation group, our job was to help
our customers succeed in their task of safe, efficient operation of
very very dangerous facilities. 

The current design of Nightscout was directly informed by personal
experience evaluating and implementing displays at oil refineries and
the like all around the world, based on guidelines written by the ASM
Consortium. The
[guidelines, recently updated](https://www.createspace.com/4466017)
are also available for purchase.

Here's a short summary of the rationale for the limited, muted colors:
