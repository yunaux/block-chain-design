# Nightscout Roadmap and Identity

> Diabetes is the enemy.

Nightscout is a combination of community, comprised of people, with
technology, comprised of open source software and hardware.  Open
source software develops in a diverse "Bazaar", a community of people
with diverse experiences and talents.  A theme that unites the
decentralized efforts and the diverse perspectives is is an
overwhelming desire to do everything possible to make "Diabetes" a
common enemy.  By making diabetes the common enemy, the community
provides a venue for beneficial collaborations to take place,
accelerating and improving diabetes therapy.

### Designing Nightscout

> Paving the cowpaths, filling the gaps.

Nightscout's design reflects the needs of the people who use
it because the users are co-developers and designers of the software.
Social media provides a way for everyone in the community to enhance
the software, and the community itself, making everyone safer in the process.
Here are common questions that led the creation of Nightscout, and
continue to drive development:

> Why do the buttons fall off? Why can't any of my family correctly
> understand how to read the device? Why does
> everyone I've tested incorrectly interpret the alarm screens? Why
> does the usb port break? Why won't this device be quiet when needed
> for two hours? Why do I need to care for and maintain so many
> devices? Why can't I get decent therapy with the "best" devices? If
> therapy is so "safe" why do I get so many highs and lows? Why can't
> I even get access to the supplies I need? Why is this device
> preventing me from working and sleeping? Why allow technology so
> much political control over our lives?


After interviewing developers, users, support, advocates of
Nightscout, surveying Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, IRC, Github, among
other social networks, and working extensively with the FDA over the
past year, I'm proposing a roadmap intended to provide some oversight
and transparency for where Nightscout is likely headed.  Hopefully
this will also help people ascertain how and where they can help.
Jason Calabrese actually provided simple 3 step outline that
seems to represent the intentions of many community members in the
future:


### Proposed Roadmap

1. **Monitoring** - *Nightscout Today*
  * Improving fidelity of therapy: allow predicting, targeting, and
    reproducing desired A1C's, reducing hypoglycemias, increasing time
    in range, restoring family dynamics, reduced burden through
    ubiquitous, persistent, glanceable displays.
  * FDA approved, open source class ~~III~~ II de novo medical device provides
    these benefits:

    * Safe and effective
    * Can promote use
    * Can re-use work
    * Will provide legitimacy, allow relationships, legalized growth
    * Can publish to science journals, allow researchers to discover new
      therapies
    * Provides re-usable work to discuss other projects that have branched off
      from Nightscout with the public, researchers, and the FDA)
  * Enabling multiuser and Authorization modes for secure access to data based
    on role, time, or selection

1. **Predict**, *Moving Towards an Intellegent Future*
  * Improving fidelity of care: improving accuracy of insulin dosing.
  * Understand, prove through prediction how glycemia works,
    mathematically modeling influences on glucose.
  * Create tools for optimizing, understanding basal rates, `I:C` and
    `ISF` ratios and other related metrics.
  * Working with clinics/doctors, Dr and patient work together with NS
    as a common view of relevant activity.
  * Educational Focus, eg "Here are possible ways your body may respond to
    planned activity over time".  Contrasting observed therapy with planned
    therapy to show the gaps.

1. **Control**, *Closing the Loop in a Safe and Open Manner*
  * Automating previous work through suggestions, high fidelity care.
  * IDE with FDA, re-using established process
  * Making open source AP easy to use, accessible
    * Dosing insulin properly using new, conservative, reviewed, safe
      techniques
  * De novo FDA approval, first class III open source device,
    reviewable, understandable, by and for the world.  High fidelity
    therapy.
  * Dynamic basal
  * Calendar, location integration

### `#wearenotwaiting`

What does `#wearenotwaiting` mean?  Will we wait for vendors who disagree to
integrate the hardware we need into forms we can use?  Will we trust an
algorithm that we cannot improve and test ourselves?  Will we accept arbitrary
limits on how with whom we can share data our?  Will we take advantage of the
opportunities to work with vendors and FDA to improve the safety and
efficacy of our care?  What role should our community have in helping
the next generation of products?

The users and developers will adapt the technology to continue to meet
our needs.  Nightscout wasn't created out of a love for phones and
cables, it was created out of a desire to increase and promote safety.
We hope this roadmap helps provide some insight on how Nightscout
might change over time, what to expect in the future from the
community, as well as how to help.

### Status-Quo

Who owns the responsibility for for therapy?  In some countries,
devices are not allowed to advertise as providing therapy.

> Devices don't give therapy, people do.

We hope the industry will embrace respect for the dangers patients
face, and engage us in making the world a safer place.
